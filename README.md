JMatch
======

JMatch is a library that allows for variable pattern matching of Strings in Java.

Variable pattern matching defines patterns such as:<br>
`"abba"`

This pattern does not restrict what `"a"` and `"b"` can be but instead defines a relation between the two variables. For example, `"dogcatcatdog"` would be a valid match to the above pattern with the assignments:<br>
`"a" = "dog"`<br>
`"b" = "cat"`
