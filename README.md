JMatch
======

JMatch is a library that allows for variable pattern matching of Strings in Java. JMatch is designed to be simple to use and easy to understand.

### Variable Pattern Matching
Variable pattern matching defines patterns such as:<br>
`"xyyx"`

This pattern does not restrict what `"x"` and `"y"` can be but instead defines a relation between the two variables. For example, `"dogcatcatdog"` would be a valid match to the above pattern with the assignments:<br>
`"x" = "dog"`<br>
`"y" = "cat"`
